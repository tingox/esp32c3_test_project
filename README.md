# esp32c3 test_project

Just a simple test project for ESP32-C3, made with esp-generate

Uses the hello_rgb example from the [esp-hal-smartled](https://crates.io/crates/esp-hal-smartled/) crate. I had to modify it to make it work on this
ESP32-C3-DevKitC-02 devkit. Not sure why the cfg-if magic didn't work.
